              Parents and policy makers all agree - early childhood is a pivotal
              phase in human development as the child learns and develops the
              most in this period. In India, this is seen through the widespread
              presence of government anganwadis and balwadis, and the large
              number of private preschools that are opening to cater to parental
              demand.And yet, many children face a severe lack of quality
              education in government centers, and low fee pre-primary schools.
              The India Early Childhood Education Impact (IECEI) longitudinal
              study showed that participation in good quality preschools leads
              to higher school readiness levels, which in turn lead to better
              early grade outcomes.

              English literacy presents a significant challenge in Indian
              classrooms, where students consistently struggle in reading and
              writing assessments. Existing FLN programs fall short of what
              current research and evidence have shown to work in early
              literacy, which is systematic and explicit phonics instruction,
              accompanied by authentic reading and writing tasks.English
              language teaching in schools often focuses on one strand, with
              mainstream schools using NCERT textbooks without teaching
              systematic decoding. This leads to a disconnect between textbook
              expectations and early readers' capabilities. Pre-primary schools
              often emphasize rote learning of alphabet names and writing,
              sprinkled with some phonics activities and decodables.

              Childrenâ€™s languages empower them to communicate with others, but
              also provide them an anchor to their culture and identity. At
              IMLi, we believe in the power of multilingual education in the
              classroom and beyond.Students who are taught in their mother
              tongue or home language perform better academically. Access to the
              curriculum becomes easier, leading to confident learners who can
              transfer their skills and knowledge to other languages.We believe
              that multilingual education implies ensuring equal opportunities
              for learning, regardless of a student's linguistic background. It
              fosters a sense of belonging, identity, and reduces
              discrimination. Our approach caters to the linguistic realities
              and needs of learners while respecting constitutional provisions
              and the National Education Policy.

              In a rapidly changing global landscape, the traditional focus on
              academic achievements is no longer sufficient. The need for
              empathy and compassion is paramount in fostering harmonious
              societies. Mindfulness contributes to mental well-being and
              enhances the learning process. SEL improves student's attitudes
              toward learning and their self-awareness and self-efficacy.
              Critical inquiry equips children with the ability to think deeply,
              solve problems, and navigate the complex information ecosystem.At
              IMLi Education, we recognize the evolving demands of the 21st
              century and the vital role of education in meeting these
              challenges. Our 3D Learning Program is designed to integrate
              Socio-Emotional Learning (SEL) and essential 21st-century skills,
              focusing on Empathy, Mindfulness, Compassion, and Critical Inquiry
              (EMCC).
